      <h1>About MoonDucky</h1>
      <h2>Carla Young</h2>
      <p>Carla Young studied both Philosophy and modern dance at Connecticut College where she was a member of the performing dance company. After graduation she taught dance at the Agnes Irwin School in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, while earning her M.A. degree in Philosophy at the graduate school of Bryn Mawr College. She then taught Philosopy and Logic at Ursinus College and later at Gwynedd Mercy College, both in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>While teaching at Gwynedd Mercy Carla wrote the script and songs for a family musical, "Flying Horses" which she produced on the college's stage in collaboration with music director Bill Monaghan. Over the next few years she collaborated with musician and singer Barry Preston to co-write and produce numerous children's songs, some of which were sung by vocalist Ella Csircsu.</p>
      <p>In 2006 Carla moved to Hilton Head, South Carolina, where she now resides with her husband Tom. While in Hilton Head she was fortunate to meet Dana Rose, Filmmaker, Art and Media Specialist, and Audio Designer. Together they embarked on the challenging project of creating animated films based on the children's music. Carla painted backgrounds, created stencil and collage elements, and made line drawings of the characters. Dana artfully composed scenes from the elements Carla gave her, shot live video, colorized and animated the characters, worked on the soundtracks, and contributed many amazing ideas. It was a truly perfect combination! In 2012 Carla founded Moon Ducky LLC for the production of children's music and films.</p>
      <p>Carla and Dana's films "Hamsters Want to be Free" and "Mechanical Cow" were screened at the 2013 Beaufort International Film Festival in South Carolina, and "Mechanical Cow" was part of the 2013 Philadelphia Independent Film Festival, the 2014 New Hope PA Film Festival, and the 2015 Garden State Film Festival in Atlantic City. Their latest film, "Kitty Cat Comes to Town" was screened at an event sponsored by the Philadelphia Independent Film Festival at the Philadelphia Art Alliance in October 2015.</p>

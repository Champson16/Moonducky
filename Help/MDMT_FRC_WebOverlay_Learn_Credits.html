      <h1>About MoonDucky</h1>
      <h2>Carla Young</h2>
      <p>Carla Young studied both Philosophy and modern dance at Connecticut College where she was a member of the performing dance company. After graduation she taught dance at the Agnes Irwin School in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, while earning her M.A. degree in Philosophy at the graduate school of Bryn Mawr College. She then taught Philosopy and Logic at Ursinus College and later at Gwynedd Mercy College, both in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>While teaching at Gwynedd Mercy Carla wrote the script and songs for a family musical, "Flying Horses" which she produced on the college's stage in collaboration with music director Bill Monaghan. Over the next few years she collaborated with musician and singer Barry Preston to co-write and produce numerous children's songs, some of which were sung by vocalist Ella Csircsu.</p>
      <p>In 2006 Carla moved to Hilton Head, South Carolina, where she now resides with her husband Tom. While in Hilton Head she was fortunate to meet Dana Rose, Filmmaker, Art and Media Specialist, and Audio Designer. Together they embarked on the challenging project of creating animated films based on the children's music. Carla painted backgrounds, created stencil and collage elements, and made line drawings of the characters. Dana artfully composed scenes from the elements Carla gave her, shot live video, colorized and animated the characters, worked on the soundtracks, and contributed many amazing ideas. It was a truly perfect combination! In 2012 Carla founded Moon Ducky LLC for the production of children's music and films.</p>
      <p>Carla and Dana's films "Hamsters Want to be Free" and "Mechanical Cow" were screened at the 2013 Beaufort International Film Festival in South Carolina, and "Mechanical Cow" was part of the 2013 Philadelphia Independent Film Festival, the 2014 New Hope PA Film Festival, and the 2015 Garden State Film Festival in Atlantic City. Their latest film, "Kitty Cat Comes to Town" was screened at an event sponsored by the Philadelphia Independent Film Festival at the Philadelphia Art Alliance in October 2015.</p>
      <h2>Dana Rose</h2>
      <p>Dana Rose graduated magna cum laude from the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design in Savannah, GA.   An artist whose palette has always sought to meld digital video and sound waves with paint and ink.  Her wide ranging art and audio/video experience extends from radio, recording studio, and television production to corporate marketing and fundraising.   In 2006, she launched her own media arts company, Mine Studios LLC, in a quest to utilize the powerful potential of the human imagination to excavate the infinite possibilities in the marriage of art and technology.</p>
      <h2>Barry Guy Preston</h2>
      <p>Originally from New Jersey, Barry moved to Philadelphia as a child and has been playing in area bands since he was 15, making appearances from Boston to Florida.  A master musician, song writer, and vocalist who transcends time &amp; genre, Preston plays electric and acoustic guitar, slide guitar, banjo, mandolin, harmonica, piano, and Hammond organ.  He also has a background in horn and string arrangement.</p>
      <p>A prolific writer, Preston creates compelling songs that range in feel from savage to tender and incorporate elements of blues, jazz, funk, R&amp;B, and rock 'n roll.  Having worked with industry greats including Grammy Award Winning John Seymour, Preston has proved to be a powerful force. He has produced numerous works with his band, &quot;Mongrel Mix&quot; at a recording studio owned and operated by Preston just outside of Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Barry has also made a splash in the arena of Children's Music. He and Carla Young have co-written and produced two albums, &quot;Ride a White Stallion&quot; and &quot;Hamsters Want to be Free&quot;, dedicated to the wonders, delights, and puzzlements of childhood. Several of these songs have become the basis of animated films that Carla has produced in collaboration with videographer/animator Dana Rose.  These include &quot;Hamsters Want to be Free&quot;,  &quot;Mechanical Cow&quot;, and &quot;Kitty Cat Comes to Town&quot;. A fourth film, &quot;Quite Like Me&quot; is currently in production. These films have been screened at film festivals and events in Philadelphia, Atlantic City, New Hope, PA, and Beaufort, SC. &quot;Mechanical Cow&quot; and &quot;Hamsters Want to be Free&quot; are featured in the MoonDucky Music Theatre app. </p>

      <h2>Music Theatre Rehearsal Help</h2>
      <p>The Rehearsal experience will let you design your own shows for the Music Theatre!      </p>
      <p>When you first enter the Rehearsal experience, you will be asked which song you want to create a show for. Once you select a song, you will be able to start creating your own show! The song you select determines which instruments will be available.</p>
      <p>First, select the set design that you want for your show. You can select the SetDesign button at the bottom of the screen in the toolbar. Once you do this, you will see all of the sets that you have created and saved using the SetDesign feature. Select any set design and it will instantly be displayed on screen. You will see the generic black and white line art background until you select a SetDesign.      </p>
      <p>Next, you can add instruments to the show. Each instrument represents a specific track of music or the vocals and can only be used once. As you add instruments to the show, you are arranging the music for the song!</p>
      <p>Next, you can add characters to the show. You can use any character and you can use characters more than once if you want. Characters can be dancers or if you drag and drop them onto instruments, they will be singers or musicians. Only one character can be a singer or a musician with a specific instrument but any character can be a dancer!</p>
      <p>Next, you can dress your characters using costumes that you created using the DressingRoom feature. Select a character and then select the Costume button in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. All of the costumes you've created for that character will appear. Select a costume and your character will be instantly dressed in the costume.      </p>
      <p>You can save your show anytime and re-load a previously saved one for editing. All shows can   be edited again later.</p>
      <p>You can publish your finished show for playing using the Publish feature. Published shows cannot be edited but you can reload a saved Rehearsal show, edit it and publish it again if you would like.    </p>
